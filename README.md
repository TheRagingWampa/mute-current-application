# mute-current-application
Autohotkey script to mute the current application by pressing F1. This will ONLY mute the application that is in focus, leaving all background applications still audible.

Forked from kristoffer-tvera/mute-current-application setting F1 to work with all modifiers.

F1 is no good for you? 
[Keybinding can be changed here](AHK/mute_current_application.ahk#L4) 

To do this, you'll need to download a copy of Autohotkey yourself, download source files, make the neccesary changes, and then compile them. Or ask a friend who knows these kinda things to do it for you.

Syntax tips:

Alt = '!'

Control = '^'

Shift = '+'

+F1   then becomes Shift+F1 on keyboard.

^m    then becomes Control+M on keyboard.

^+m 	then becomes control + shift + m on keyboard

It is possible to stack multiple keybinds on top of each other to all perform the same action.
